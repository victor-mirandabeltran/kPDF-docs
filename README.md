## :art: Versatility:

With **kPdfDocs**, the creation of complex documents is simplified. It provides you with the necessary tools to design
intricate layouts, tables, or structured sections effectively.

## :wrench: High-Level API:

kPdfDocs offers a high-level API to further ease the creation of complex documents. This allows you to seamlessly
develop the layout that suits your needs.

While Apache PDFBox is utilized as a low-level library, the focus of **kPdfDocs** is not primarily on PDFBox, but to
offer a user-friendly interface that makes it simple for developers to produce high-quality PDF documents, no matter
their complexity.

To put it simply, if the requirement is about creating any type of documents with layouts, tables, sections, or any
complex structures, **kPdfDocs** empowers you to do so effortlessly.

Moreover, **kPdfDocs** is in development to serve as a comprehensive alternative to the restrictive iText library, which
is encumbered by an AGPL license that limits its utility. Essentially, **kPdfDocs** serves as a replacement to iText,
the low-level PDF generation component of JasperReports. The eventual goal is to evolve this library into a modern and
superior alternative to JasperReports, with **kPdfDocs** being its core PDF engine.

compared to AGPL-encumbered libraries.
